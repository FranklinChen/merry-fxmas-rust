# merry-fxmas

Say "Merry Christmas" 25 times, using a syntactic macro in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

Tested with Rust [0.7](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/release-0.7/RELEASES.txt).

## Usage

Edit `Makefile` to point to where you installed the Rust compiler `rustc`.

To compile:

``` console
$ make
```

To see the output:

``` console
$ make run
```
